title: Demystifying hidden units!
---

Welcome!! The last decade saw the emergence of various Deep Neural Networks(DNN) architectures. Almost, every analytics and prediction problem is seen through the DNN's lens. The genral trend is to increase the number of hidden layers for better results. But nobody knew what exactly goes inside DNN's that makes them work. 

Genrally, DNN's are seen as black box . This is an attempt to zoom inside these architectures and demystfy the building blocks i.e hidden units.

The website will feature each architectures(NN, CNN, RNN, LSTM etc) and breakdown into a series of blogs.

Stay tuned !!
